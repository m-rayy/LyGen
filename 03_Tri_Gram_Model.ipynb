I know all, where thou thine eye didst sink in the pure well of Mim.\\nMim drinks mead each morn from Valfather’s pledge.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nThe chief of hosts gave her rings and necklace, useful discourse, and a divining spirit: wide and far she saw o’er every world.\\nShe the Valkyriur saw from afar coming, ready to ride to the gods’ people: Skuld held a shield, Skögul was second, then Gunn, Hild, Göndul, and Geirskögul.\\nNow are enumerated Herian’s maidens, the Valkyriur, ready over the earth to ride.\\nShe that war remembers, the first on earth, when Gullveig6 they with lances pierced, and in the high one’s hall her burnt, thrice burnt, thrice brought her forth, oft not seldom; yet she still lives.\\nHeidi they called her, whithersoe’r she came, the well-foreseeing Vala: wolves she tamed, magic arts she knew, magic arts practised; ever was she the joy of evil people.\\nThen went the powers all to their judgement-seats, the all-holy gods, and thereon held council, whether the Æsir should avenge the crime, or all the gods receive atonement.\\nBroken was the outer wall of the Æsir’s burgh.\\nThe Vanir, foreseeing conflict tramp oér the plains.\\nOdin cast (his spear), and mid the people hurled it: that was the first warfare in the world.\\nThen went the powers all to their judgement-seats, the all-holy gods, and thereon held council: who had all the air with evil mingled?\\nor to the Jötun race Od’s maid had given?\\nThere alone was Thor with anger swollen.\\nHe seldom sits, when of the like he hears.\\nOaths are not held sacred; nor words, nor swearing, nor binding compacts reciprocally made.\\nShe knows that Heimdall’s horn is hidden under the heaven-bright holy tree.\\nA river she sees flow, with foamy fall, from Valfather’s pledge.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nEast sat the crone, in Iárnvidir, Fenrir’s progeny: of all shall be one especially the moon’s devourer, in a troll’s semblance.\\nHe is sated with the last breath of dying men; the gods’ seat he with red gore defiles: swart is the sunshine then for summers after; all weather turns to storm.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nThere on a height sat, striking a harp, the giantess’s watch, the joyous Egdir; by him crowed, in the bird-wood, the bright red cock, which Fialar hight.\\nCrowed o’er the Æsir Gullinkambi, which wakens heroes with the sire of hosts; but another crows beneath the earth, a soot-red cock, in the halls of Hel.\\nI saw of Baldr, the blood-stained god, Odin’s son, the hidden fate.\\nThere stood grown up, high on the plain, slender and passing fair, the mistletoe.\\nFrom that shrub was made, as to me it seemed, a deadly, noxious dart.\\nHödr shot it forth; But Frigg bewailed, in Fensalir, Valhall’s calamity.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nBound she saw lying, under Hveralund, a monstrous form, to Loki like.\\nThere sits Sigyn, for her consort’s sake, not right glad.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nThen the Vala knew the fatal bonds were twisting, most rigid, bonds from entrails made.\\nFrom the east a river falls, through venom dales, with mire and clods, Slid is its name.\\nOn the north there stood, on Nida-fells, a hall of gold, for Sindri’s race; and another stood in Okolnir, the Jötuns beer-hall which Brimir hight.\\nShe saw a hall standing, far from the sun, in Náströnd; its doors are northward turned, venom-drops fall in through its apertures: entwined is that hall with serpent’s backs.\\nShe there saw wading the sluggish streams bloodthirsty men and perjurers, and him who the ear beguiles of another’s wife.\\nThere Nidhögg sucks the corpses of the dead; the wolf tears men.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nFurther forward I see, much can I say of Ragnarök and the gods’ conflict.\\nBrothers shall fight, and slay each other; cousins shall kinship violate.\\nThe earth resounds, the giantesses flee; no man will another spare.\\nHard is it in the world, great whoredom, an axe age, a sword age, shields will be cloven, a wind age, a wolf age, ere the world sinks.\\nMim’s sons dance, but the central tree takes fire, at the resounding Gjallar-horn.\\nLoud blows Heimdall, his horn is raised; Odin speaks with Mim’s head.\\nTrembles Yggdrasil’s ash yet standing; groans that aged tree, and the jötun is loosed.\\nLoud bays Garm before the Gnupa-cave, his bonds he rends asunder; and the wolf runs.\\nHrym steers from the east, the waters rise, the mundane snake is coiled in jötun-rage.\\nThe worm beats the water, and the eagle screams: the pale of beak tears carcases; Naglfar is loosed.\\nThat ship fares from the east: come will Muspell’s people o’er the sea, and Loki steers.\\nThe monster’s kin goes all with the wolf; with them the brother is of Byleist on their course.\\nSurt from the south comes with flickering flame; shines from his sword the Val-god’s sun.\\nThe stony hills are dashed together, the giantesses totter; men tread the path of Hel, and heaven is cloven.\\nHow is it with the Æsir? How with the Alfar?\\nAll Jötunheim resounds; the Æsir are in council.\\nThe dwarfs groan before their stony doors, the sages of the rocky walls.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nThen arises Hlin’s second grief, when Odin goes with the wolf to fight, and the bright slayer of Beli with Surt.\\nThen will Frigg’s beloved fall.\\nThen comes the great victor-sire’s son, Vidar, to fight with the deadly beast.\\nHe with his hands will make his sword pierce to the heart of the giant’s son: then avenges he his father.\\nThen comes the mighty son of Hlódyn: (Odin’s son goes with the monster to fight); Midgárd’s Veor in his rage will slay the worm.\\nNine feet will go Fiörgyn’s son, bowed by the serpent, who feared no foe.\\nAll men will their homes forsake.\\nThe sun darkens, earth in ocean sinks, fall from heaven the bright stars, fire’s breath assails the all-nourishing tree, towering fire plays against heaven itself.\\nShe sees arise, a second time, earth from ocean, beauteously green, waterfalls descending; the eagle flying over, which in the fell captures fish.\\nThe Æsir meet on Ida’s plain, and of the mighty earth-encircler speak, and there to memory call their mighty deeds, and the supreme god’s ancient lore.\\nThere shall again  the wondrous golden tables in the grass be found, which in days of old had possessed the ruler of the gods, and Fjölnir’s race.\\nUnsown shall the fields bring forth, all evil be amended; Baldr shall come; Hödr and Baldr, the heavenly gods, Hropt’s glorious dwellings shall inhabit.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nThen can Hoenir choose his lot, and the two brother’s sons inhabit the spacious Vindheim.\\nUnderstand ye yet, or what?\\nShe a hall sees standing than the sun brighter, with gold bedecked, in Gimill: there shall the righteous people dwell, and for evermore happiness enjoy.\\nThen comes the mighty one to the great judgement, the powerful from above, who rules o’er all.\\nHe shall dooms pronounce, and strifes allay, holy peace establish, which shall ever be.\\nThere comes the dark dragon flying from beneath, the glistening serpent, from Nida-fells.\\nOn his wings bears Nidhögg, flying o’er the plain, a corpse.\\nNow she will descend.'"

       "'Maids flew from the south, through the murky wood, Alvit the young, fate to fulfil.\\nOne of them, of maidens fairest, to his comely breast Egil clasped.\\nSvanhvit was the second, she a swan’s plumage bore; but the third, their sister, the white neck clasped of Völund.\\nThere they stayed seven winters through; but all the eighth were with longing seized; and in the ninth fate parted them.\\nThe maidens yearned for the murky wood, the young Alvit, fate to fulfil.\\nFrom the chase came the ardent hunters, Slagfid and Egil, found their house deserted,went out and in, and looked around.\\nEgil went east after Ölrún, and Slagfid west after Svanhvit; But Völund alone remained in Ulfdal.\\nHe the red gold set with the hard gem, well fastened all the rings on linden bast, and so awaited his bright consort, if to him she would return.\\nIt was told to Nidud, the Niarars’ lord, that Völund alone remained in Ulfdal.\\nIn the night went men, in studded corslets, their shields glistened in the waning moon.\\nFrom their saddles they alighted at the house’s gable, thence went in through the house.\\nOn the bast they saw the rings all drawn, seven hundred, which the warrior owned.\\nAnd they took them off, and they put them on, all save one, which they bore away.\\nCame then from the chase the ardent hunter, Völund, gliding on the long way.\\nTo the fire he went, bear’s flesh to roast.\\nSoon blazed the brushwood, and the arid fir, the wind-dried wood, before Völund.\\nOn the bearskin sat, his rings counted, the Alfar’s companion: one was missing.\\nHe thought that Hlödver´s daughter had it, the young Alvit, and that she was returned.\\nSo long he sat until he slept; and he awoke of joy bereft: on his hands he felt heavy constraints, and round his feet fetters clasped.\\n“Who are the men that on the rings’ possessor have laid bonds? and me have bound?”\\nThen cried Nidud, the Niarars’ lord: Whence gottest thou, Völund! Alfars’ chief! our gold, in Ulfdal?\\nNo gold was here in Grani’s path, far I thought our land from the hills of Rhine.\\nI mind me that we more treasures possessed, when, a whole family, we were at home.\\nHladgud and Hervör were of Hlödver born; know was Ölrún, Kiar’s daughter, she entered into the house, stood on the floor, her voice moderated: Now is he not mirthful, who from the forest comes.\\nHis teeth he shows, when the sword he sees, and Bödvild’s ring he recognizes: threatening are his eyes as a glistening serpent’s: let be severed his sinews’ strength; and set him then in Sævarstad.\\nThe sword shines in Nidud’s belt, which I whetted as I could most skillfully, and tempered, as seemed to me most cunningly.\\nThat bright blade for ever is taken from me: never shall I see it borne into Völund’s smithy.\\nNow Bödvild wears my consort’s red-gold rings: for this I have no indemnity.\\nHe sat and never slept, and his hammer plied; but much more speedy vengeance devised on Nidud.\\nThe two young sons of Nidud ran in at the door to look, in Sævarstad.\\nTo the chest they came, for the keys asked; manifest was their grudge, when therein they looked.\\nMany necklaces were there, which to those youths appeared of the red gold to be, and treasures.\\nCome ye two alone, to-morrow come; that gold shall be given to you.\\nTell it not to the maidens, nor to the household folk, nor to any one, that ye have been with me.\\nEarly called one the other, brother, brother: Let us go see the rings.\\nTo the chest they came, for the keys asked; manifest was their grudge, when therein they looked.\\nOf those children he the heads cut off, and under the prison’s mixen laid their bodies.\\nBut their skulls beneath the hair he in silver set, and to Nidud gave; and of their eyes precious stones he formed, which to Nidud’s wily wife he sent.\\nBut of the teeth of the two breast-ornaments he made, and to Bödvild sent.\\nThen did Bödvild praise the ring: to Völund brought it, when she had broken it: I dare to no one tell it, save alone to thee.\\nVölund I will so repair the fractured gold, that to thy father it shall fairer seem, and to thy mother much more beautiful, and to thyself, in the same degree.\\nHe then brought her beer, that he might succeed the better, as on her seat she fell asleep.\\nNow have I my wrongs avenged, all save one in the wood perpetrated.\\nI wish, said Völund, that on my feet I were, of the use of which Nidud’s men have deprived me.\\nLaughing Völund rose in the air: Bödvild weeping from the isle departed.\\nShe mourned her lover’s absence, and for her father’s wrath.\\nStood without Nidud’s wily wife; then she went in through the hall; but he on the enclosure sat down to rest.\\nArt thou awake Niarars’ lord!\\nEver am I awake, joyless I lie to rest, when I call to mind my children’s death: my head is chilled, cold are to me thy counsels.\\nNow with Völund I desire to speak.\\nTell me, Völund, Alfars’ chief! of my brave boys what is become?\\nOaths shalt thou first to me swear, by board of ship, by rim of shield, by shoulder of steed, by edge of sword, that thou wilt not slay the wife of Völund, nor of my bride cause the death; although a  wife I have whom ye know, or offspring within thy court.\\nTo the smithy go, which thou has made, there wilt thou the bellows find with blood besprinkled.\\nThe heads I severed of thy boys, and under the prison’s mixen laid their bodies.\\nBut their skulls beneath the hair I in silver set, and to Nidud gave; and of their eyes precious stones I formed, which to Nidud’s wily wife I sent.\\nOf the teeth of the two, breast-ornaments I made, and to Bödvild sent.\\nNow Bödvild goes big with child, the only daughter of you both.\\nWord didst thou never speak that more afflicted me, or for which I would more severely punish thee.\\nThere is no man so tall that he from thy horse can take thee, or so skilful that he can shoot thee down, thence where thou floatest up in the sky.\\nLaughing Völund rose in air, but Nidud sad remained sitting.\\nRise up Thakrád, my best of thralls! bid Bödvild, my fair-browed daughter, in bright attire come, with her sire to speak.\\nIs it, Bödvild! true what has been told to me, that thou and Völund in the isle together sat\\nTrue it is, Nidud! what has been told to thee, that Völund and I in the isle together sat, in an unlucky hour: would it had never been!\\nI could not against him strive, I might not against him prevail.'"
